### Description of our case study (SchedulingSystem)

In this case study named SchedulingSytem.java., we build a simple scheduling system where the user can add subjects, drop subjects, display the timetable, and exit the program. We have fulfilled all the requirements needed. It contains 25 slots a week from Monday to Friday excluding lunch time. For the add subject function, 1 subject only has 2 meetings in a week. The next class will be scheduled the day after the week's first class. For the drop subject function, the user can drop subjects after adding the subject to the schedule. However, the drop function only works for the subject that is available in the slot that the user selected. For display subjects, there will be days, times, and courses that the user has added to the scheduling system.
